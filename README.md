# Models for ROSS

These models originally shipped with [ROSS](http://github.com/carothersc/ROSS).
Use the models in the [legacy]() branch with the [ROSS-Legacy version](https://github.com/carothersc/ROSS/releases/tag/Legacy).
Or, use any of the models in the master branch with regular ROSS.

# Installation

To build these models with ROSS, you simply need to sym-link the ROSS-models folder into the ROSS/models folder.
Or, link any single model you choose.

```
cd ~/Projects
git clone git@github.com:carothersc/ROSS
git clone git@github.com:gonsie/ROSS-models
ln -s ~/Projects/ROSS-models ROSS/models/
```
Note: You should specify the full path to ROSS-models when creating the symbolic link.
