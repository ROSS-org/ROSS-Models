# Models for ROSS

These models originally shipped with [ROSS](http://github.com/ross-org/ROSS).
Use the models in the [legacy]() branch with the [ROSS-Legacy version](https://github.com/ross-org/ROSS/releases/tag/Legacy).
Or, use any of the models in the master branch with regular ROSS.

Some models herein are included only for historical purposes.
They are currently considered *deprecated* and should not be used for future development.
